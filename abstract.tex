Web services, like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox, 
are a regular part of users' lives. 
As a form of payment, these services
collect, store, and analyze user data.
Even accessing these web services can leak a substantial
amount of data. 

This dissertation presents two practical,
secure systems, Veil and Splinter, that
prevents some of this data leakage. Veil protects 
client-side data leakage through the browser by allowing
web page developers to enforce stronger private browsing 
semantics without browser support. Splinter keeps users' 
queries to web services private with minimal trust.
