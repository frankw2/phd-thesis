Web services, like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox, 
are a regular part of users' lives. 
As a form of payment, these services
collect, store, and analyze user data.
Even accessing these web services can leak a substantial
amount of data. 

This dissertation presents two practical,
secure systems, Veil and Splinter, that
prevents some of this data leakage. Veil minimizes
client-side information leakage from the browser by allowing
web page developers to enforce stronger private browsing 
semantics without browser support. Splinter protects
sensitive information present in a users' query on cleartext datasets
in a practical manner by leveraging a recent cryptographic
primitive, Function Secret Sharing (FSS).
