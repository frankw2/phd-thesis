Web services like Google, Facebook, and Dropbox 
are a regular part of users' lives. However,
using these applications can cause sensitive data
leakage both on the server and client.
On the server-side, applications collect and analyze
sensitive user data to monetize it. Consequently,
this sensitive data can leak through data breaches
or accessed by malicious database administrators. 
On the client, when a user accesses a web service
through the browser, sensitive user information
may leak outside of the browser, 
e.g., to DNS interfaces or the swap space.
As a result, an attacker who accesses the user
device after a session has terminated can view
this information.

This dissertation presents two practical,
secure systems, Veil and Splinter, that
prevents some of this data leakage. Veil minimizes
client-side information leakage from the browser by allowing
web page developers to enforce stronger private browsing 
semantics without browser support. Splinter 
allows the server to properly respond to a user
query without the server learning any sensitive
information present in the query.
