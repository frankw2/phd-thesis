\section{Splinter: Practical, Private Web Application Queries}
\label{chap:splinter}

This chapter presents Splinter, a practical system that protects user
queries to web applications.

\subsection{Motivation}
Many online services let users query large datasets:
some examples include restaurant sites, stock quotes,
medical information, and patents. In these services, 
any user can query the data, and the datasets themselves
are not sensitive. However, web services can infer a great deal of identifiable and sensitive
user information from these queries, such as her 
political affiliation, sexual orientation, income,
medical conditions, behavior, etc.~\cite{narayanan2010myths, narayanan2008robust}.
Web services can use this information maliciously and put users at risk to practices such as
discriminatory pricing~\cite{amazon-disc-pricing, price-disc2, hannak2014measuring}.
For example, online stores have charged users different prices based on location~\cite{price-disc}, and
travel sites have also increased prices for certain frequently searched flights~\cite{travel-pricing}.
Even when the services are honest, server compromise and subpoenas can leak the sensitive user
information on these services~\cite{ravichandran2009capturing, yelp-compromise, twitter-compromise}.

This paper presents Splinter, a system that protects users' queries to web applications
while achieving practical performance for many current web applications.
In Splinter, the user divides each query into shares and sends them to different
\emph{providers}, which are services hosting a copy of the dataset (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}).
As long as any one of the providers is honest and does not
collude with the others, the providers cannot discover sensitive
information in the query.
However, given responses from all the providers, the user
can compute the answer to her query.

\end{figure}

Previous private query systems have generally not achieved practical performance
because they use expensive cryptographic primitives and protocols.
For example, systems based on Private Information Retrieval (PIR)~\cite{goldberg,chor1997private,pir-search} require many round trips and high bandwidth for complex queries, while systems based on garbled
circuits~\cite{wu2016,lan2016embark,ben2008fairplaymp} have a high computational cost.
These approaches are especially costly for mobile clients on high-latency networks.

Instead, Splinter is the first system to use and extend a recent cryptographic primitive called
Function Secret Sharing (FSS)~\cite{fss, gilboa2014distributed} for private queries.
FSS allows the client to split certain functions into shares that keep parameters of the
function hidden unless all the providers collude.
With judicious use of FSS, many queries can be answered at low CPU and bandwidth cost in only a single network round trip.

Splinter makes two contributions over previous work on FSS.
First, prior work has only demonstrated efficient FSS protocols for point and interval functions with additive aggregates such as SUMs~\cite{fss}.
We present protocols that support a more complex set of non-additive aggregates such as MAX/MIN and TOPK at low computational and communication cost.
Together, these protocols let Splinter support a subset of SQL that can capture many popular online applications.

Second, we develop an optimized implementation of FSS for modern hardware that leverages AES-NI~\cite{aes-ni} instructions and multicore CPUs.
For example, using the one-way compression functions that utilize modern AES instruction sets, our implementation is 2.5$\times$ faster per core than a na\"ive implementation of FSS.
Together, these optimizations let Splinter query datasets with millions of records at sub-second latency on a single server.

We evaluate Splinter by implementing 
three applications over it: a restaurant review site similar to Yelp, 
airline ticket search, and map routing.
For all of our applications, Splinter can execute queries in less than 1.6 seconds, at a cost of less than 0.005 cents in server resources on Amazon EC2.
Splinter's low cost means that providers could profitably run a Splinter-based service
similar to OpenStreetMap routing~\cite{osm}, an open-source maps service, while only charging users a few dollars per month.

%Finally, Splinter does have some limitations.
%First, FSS, like PIR, requires scanning the whole input dataset on
%every query, to prevent providers from figuring out which records have
%been accessed.
%Second, Splinter does not support some SQL features, such as private join conditions.
%Despite these limitations, we show that Splinter is practical on large
%real-world datasets, such as maps, and can support many of today's online applications.
%Because human-created datasets are unlikely to grow faster than
%hardware capabilities in the future, we believe Splinter's techniques will only
%become more practical over time.

%FSS improves over PIR 
%because it allows matching \textit{multiple} records efficiently in one scan
%while practical PIR schemes can only match a single record in one scan. 
%Therefore, to the best of our knowledge,
%Splinter is the first system to practically preserve the privacy 
%of queries on large public datasets.

%In summary, our contributions are:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item{Splinter, a private query system that achieves significantly lower CPU and communication costs than previous systems.}
%	\item{New protocols that extend FSS to complex queries with non-additive aggregates, e.g., TOPK and MAX.}
%	\item{An optimized FSS implementation for modern CPUs.}
%	\item{An evaluation of Splinter on realistic applications.}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Splinter Architecture}
\label{sec:goals}

Splinter aims to protect sensitive information in users' queries
from providers. This section provides an overview of Splinter's architecture,
security goals, and threat model.

\subsubsection{Splinter Overview}
\label{sec:model}
There are two main principals in Splinter: the \emph{user} and the \emph{providers}.
Each provider hosts a copy of the data. Providers can 
retrieve this data from a public repository or mirror site.
For example, OpenStreetMap~\cite{osm} publishes publicly available 
map, point-of-interest, and traffic data. 
For a given user query, all the providers have to run it on the same
view of the data. Maintaining data consistency
from mirror sites is beyond the scope of this paper, but
standard techniques can be used~\cite{tewari2002wcdp,chi2008novel}.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}, 
to issue a query in Splinter, a user
splits her query into \textit{shares}, using the Splinter client,
and submits each share to a different provider.
The user can select any providers of her choice that host the dataset.
The providers use their shares to execute the user's query 
over the cleartext public data, using the Splinter provider library. 
As long as one provider is \textit{honest}
(does not collude with others), the user's sensitive information in the original query
remains private. When the user receives the responses from the providers,
she combines them to obtain the final answer to her original query. 
%In Section~\ref{sec:queries},
%we will describe in more detail how the user creates these function shares and how
%the provider uses them to execute the user's query.

\subsubsection{Security Goals}
\label{sec:query_model}
The goal of Splinter is to hide sensitive parameters in
a user's query.
Specifically, Splinter lets users run \emph{parametrized queries}, 
where both the parameters and query results are hidden from providers.
For example, consider the following query, which finds the 10 cheapest flights between a source and destination:
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT TOP 10 flightid FROM flights
WHERE source = ? AND dest = ? 
ORDER BY price
\end{verbatim}
Splinter hides the information represented by the questions marks, i.e.,
the source and destination in this example.
The column names being selected and filtered are not hidden.
Finally, Splinter also hides the query's results---otherwise,
these might be used to infer the source and destination. 
Splinter supports a subset of the SQL language, which we describe in Section~\ref{sec:querymodel}.

The easiest way to achieve this property would be for users to download the whole database
and run the queries locally.
However, this requires substantial bandwidth and computation for the user.
Moreover, many datasets change constantly, e.g., to include traffic information or new product reviews.
It would be impractical for the user to continuously download these updates.
Therefore, our performance objective is to minimize computation and communication costs.
For a database of $n$ records, Splinter only requires $O(n \log n)$ computation at the
providers and $O(\log n)$ communication (Section~\ref{sec:complex}).

\subsubsection{Threat Model}
Splinter keeps the parameters in the user's query hidden
as long as at least one of the user-chosen providers does not collude with others. 
Splinter also assumes these providers are \textit{honest but curious}: a provider can observe the interactions between
itself and the client, but 
Splinter does not protect against providers returning incorrect results or maliciously modifying the dataset.

We assume that the user communicates with each provider through a secure channel (e.g., using SSL),
and that the user's Splinter client is uncompromised. 
%Protecting attacks on a user's machine are outside of the scope of Splinter.
Our cryptographic assumptions are standard.
We only assume the existence of one-way functions in our two-provider implementation.
In our implementation for multiple providers, the security of Paillier encryption~\cite{paillier} is also assumed.





\subsection{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{spl-sec:discussion}

\paragraph{Economic feasibility:}
\label{sec:disc-economics}

Although it is hard to predict real-world deployment, we believe that Splinter's low cost makes it economically feasible for several types of applications.
Here are some possible methods for monetization.
For example, despite many current data owners, such as Yelp and Google Maps, generating revenue primarily by showing ads and mining user data,
they can license their data to Splinter providers and have these providers manage a Splinter deployment. The providers
can then charge a subscription fee, e.g. \$1 a month, for usage of the server.
Similarly, these providers can collectively issue a utility token that
can be used to pay for the queries.
Splinter's trust model, where only one provider needs to be honest, also makes 
it easy for new providers to join the market, increasing users' privacy.

This businesses seems reasonable as studies have shown that 
many consumers are willing to pay for services that protect their privacy~\cite{atlantic,atlantic2}. 
In fact, users might not use certain services because of privacy concerns~\cite{ravichandran2009capturing,riley2008tolls}.
Similarly, more users are using sites like DuckDuckGo and technologies like Tor 
because they are unwilling to have sites track their
query behavior, which shows a growing consumer market for privacy-preserving technologies. 
However, whether such a business model would work or be feasible 
in practice is beyond the scope of this dissertation.
%Well-known sites like OkCupid, Pandora, Youtube, and Slashdot allow users to 
%pay a monthly fee to remove ads that collect their information, showing there is
%already a demographic willing to pay for privacy. Moreover,

%As shown in Section~\ref{sec:pricing}, the cost of running queries on Splinter is low, with our most expensive query, map routing, costing less than 0.005 cents in AWS resources.
%At this cost, providers could offer Splinter-based map routing for a subscription fee of \$1 per month.
%Moreover, the availability of techniques like Splinter might make it easier to introduce 
%regulation about privacy in certain settings, similar to current privacy regulations in HIPAA~\cite{hipaa}
%and GDPR~\cite{gdpr}.

%Nonetheless, there are already successful open databases containing most of the data in these services, such as OpenStreetMap~\cite{osm}, and basic data on locations does not change rapidly once collected.
%There are already multiple Android and iOS applications that download subsets of OpenStreetMap data for  offline routing and update it periodically~\cite{osm-offline}.

%\subsection{Extensions to Splinter}
%\label{sec:disc-extensions}
%
%To support more workloads, Splinter's query model and evaluation algorithms can be extended in several ways.

%Finally, Splinter does have some limitations.
%First, FSS, like PIR, requires scanning the whole input dataset on
%every query, to prevent providers from figuring out which records have
%been accessed.
%Second, Splinter does not support some SQL features, such as private join conditions.
%Despite these limitations, we show that Splinter is practical on large
%real-world datasets, such as maps, and can support many of today's online applications.
%Because human-created datasets are unlikely to grow faster than
%hardware capabilities in the future, we believe Splinter's techniques will only
%become more practical over time.

\paragraph{Unsupported queries:}
As shown in Section~\ref{sec:querymodel}, Splinter supports only a subset of SQL.
Splinter does not support partial text matching or image matching, which are common in types of applications
that might use Splinter. Moreover, Splinter cannot support private joins, i.e. Splinter can only support joining with 
another table if the join condition is public. Despite these limitations, our study in Section~\ref{sec:case_studies} 
shows Splinter can support many application search interfaces.

\paragraph{Number of providers:} 
One limitation of Splinter is that 
a Splinter-based service has 
to be deployed on at least two providers. 
However, previous PIR systems described in Section~\ref{sec:related}
also require at least two providers. 

%Unlike those systems, 
%Splinter requires only \textit{one} honest provider whereas those systems
%require \textit{all} providers be honest. Moreover,
%current multi-party FSS schemes do not scale well past 
%three providers, but we believe that further research will improve its efficiency.

%\paragraph{Joins:}
%As shown in Section~\ref{sec:querymodel}, Splinter can support only joining with another table 
%if the join condition is public,
%i.e. the join condition cannot contain sensitive or private information. To do this, 
%providers can run the join before filtering the data using the private condition.
%We leave the development of private join conditions to future work.

\paragraph{Full table scans:}
FSS, like PIR, requires scanning the whole input dataset on every Splinter query,
to prevent providers from figuring out which records have been accessed. 
Despite this limitation, we have shown that Splinter is practical
on large real-world datasets, such as maps.

Splinter needs to scan the whole table only for conditions 
that contain sensitive parameters.
For example, consider the query:
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT flight from table WHERE src=SFO 
AND dst=LGA AND delay < 20
\end{verbatim}
If the user does not consider the delay of 20 in this query to be
private, Splinter could send it in the clear.
The providers can then create an intermediate
table with only flights where the delay $<$ 20 and apply the private
conditions only to records in this table.
In a similar manner, users querying geographic data may be willing to
reveal their location at the country or state level but would like to
keep their location inside the state or country private.

\paragraph{Maintaining consistent data views:}
Splinter requires that each provider executes a given user
query on the same copy of the data. 
Much research in distributed systems has focused on ensuring
databases consistency across multiple providers~\cite{spanner, ongaro:raft, tu:silo}.
Using the appropriate consistency techniques is dependent
on the application and an active area of research.
Applying those techniques in Splinter is beyond the scope
of this paper.


\subsection{Related Work}
\label{spl-sec:related}
Splinter is related to work in Private Information Retrieval (PIR),
garbled circuit systems, encrypted data systems, 
and Oblivious RAM (ORAM) systems. Splinter achieves higher performance than these systems 
through its mapping of database queries to the Function Secret Sharing (FSS) primitive.

\paragraph{PIR systems:}
Splinter is most closely related to systems that use Private
Information Retrieval (PIR)~\cite{chor1998private} to query a database privately.
In PIR, a user queries for the $i^\mathrm{th}$ record in the database, and the database
does not learn the queried index $i$ or the result.
Much work has been done on improving 
PIR protocols~\cite{ostrovsky2007survey, olumofin2011revisiting}. 
Work has also been done to extend PIR to return multiple records~\cite{groth2010multi},
but it is computationally expensive.
Our work is most closely related to the system in~\cite{goldberg}, which implements
a parametrized SQL-like query model similar to Splinter using PIR. However,
because this system uses PIR, it has up to $10\times$ more round trips 
and much higher response times for similar queries. 

Popcorn~\cite{popcorn} is a media delivery service that 
uses PIR to hide user consumption habits from the provider
and content distributor. However, Popcorn is optimized for
streaming media databases, like Netflix, which have a small number (about 8000)
of large records. 

The systems above have a weaker
security model: \textit{all} the providers need to be honest.
Splinter only requires \textit{one} honest provider, and
it is more practical because it 
extends Function Secret Sharing (FSS)~\cite{fss,gilboa2014distributed}, which lets
it execute complex operations such as sums in one round trip
instead of only extracting one data record at a time.

\paragraph{Garbled circuits:}
Systems such as Embark~\cite{lan2016embark}, BlindBox~\cite{blindbox}, 
and private shortest path computation systems~\cite{wu2016}
use garbled circuits~\cite{Yao, goldwasser1997multi} to perform private computation
on a single untrusted server.
Even with improvements in practicality~\cite{bellare2013efficient}, these
techniques still have high computation and bandwidth costs for queries on
large datasets because a new garbled circuit has to be generated for each query.
(Reusable garbled circuits~\cite{goldwasser:sfe} are not yet practical.)
For example, the recent map routing system by Wu et al.~\cite{wu2016} uses garbled circuits and 
has $100\times$ higher response time and $10\times$ higher bandwidth cost
than Splinter.

\paragraph{Encrypted data systems:}
Systems that compute on encrypted data, like 
CryptDB~\cite{popa:cryptdb}, Mylar~\cite{popa:mylar}, SPORC~\cite{feldman:sporc},
Depot~\cite{mahajan:depot}, and SUNDR~\cite{li:sundr}, all try to protect
private data against a server compromise, which is a different
problem than what Splinter tries to solve. CryptDB is most similar to Splinter 
because it allows for SQL-like queries over encrypted data. However, all
these systems protect against a single, potentially compromised server 
where the user is storing data privately, but they do not hide data access patterns. 
In contrast, Splinter hides data access patterns and a user's query parameters 
but is only designed to operate on a 
public dataset that is hosted at multiple providers.


\paragraph{ORAM systems:}
Splinter is also related to systems that use Oblivious RAM~\cite{stefanov:path-oram, lorch2013shroud}. 
ORAM allows a user to read and write data on an untrusted server without
revealing her data access patterns to the server. However, ORAM cannot be easily applied
into the Splinter setting. One main requirement of ORAM is that the user
can only read data that she has written. 
In Splinter, the provider hosts a public dataset, not created by any specific user, 
and many users need to access the same dataset.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{spl-sec:conclusion}
Splinter is a new private query system that protects sensitive parameters
in SQL-like queries while scaling to realistic applications. Splinter uses and extends a recent
cryptography primitive, Function Secret Sharing (FSS),
allowing it to achieve up to an order of magnitude better
performance compared to previous private query systems. We develop
protocols to execute complex queries
with low computation and bandwidth. As a proof of concept,
we have evaluated Splinter with three sample applications---a Yelp clone,
map routing, and flight search---and showed
that Splinter has low response times from 50 ms to 1.6 seconds with low
hosting costs.
